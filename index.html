                <strong>Snallygaster</strong><br />
                A Maryland folklore creature assembled from rumor, media, and
                fear.<br />
                We borrow the name for projects that are stitched together and
                refuse to settle into a single shape.

          <p>
            Descriptions never agree, and that is the point: a stitched together
            thing of wings, beak, claws, and rumor. Born from contradiction.
            Always in flux.
          </p>

            <p>Snally exists for projects like that.</p>

              Some sites wear neckties. This one shows up in neon sneakers, half
              finished prototypes tucked under its arm. Snally is a sandbox for
              strange web builds and offbeat, data driven sketches, where
              folklore trades campfire stories for JavaScript, CSS, Python, and
              Quarto.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here, numbers turn playful. Interfaces bend. Ideas are explored
              out loud and allowed to remain unfinished.
            </p>
          </div>

          <br />

          <p>
            Think of it as a garage after midnight. Lights on. Coffee brewing.
            Code flickering.
          </p>

          <p>Wander in and see what hatched today.</p>
